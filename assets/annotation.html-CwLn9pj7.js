Provide a definition so that others may interpret and apply this CVT term as your project intends it to be used.</li></ol><p>A third attribute is the <code>Uri</code>. This attribute is used to assert that the CVT in your project means the same things as data used in <em>others</em> projects.</p><h3 id="data-attributes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#data-attributes"><span>Data attributes</span></a></h3><p>Think of <a href="/models#data-attributes">DataAttributes</a> as custom columns on your table. There are two types in TaxonWorks, &quot;Import&quot;, and &quot;Internal&quot;. The latter are created in the user-interface, the former are used in the documentation of bulk-data import, typically for bespoke datasets. DataAttributes are key-value pairs that reference a record (or <a href="/about/glossary#object">object</a>. They reference the object the attribute is being attached to, a type of CVT called a <code>Predicate</code>, and the value.</p><h4 id="customizing-models" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#customizing-models"><span>Customizing models</span></a></h4><p>For example you might add a DataAttribute referencing a <code>Predicate</code> you created called &quot;TownshipAndRange&quot; with the value &quot;Smithville&quot; to a CollectingEvent.</p><h4 id="darwin-core-exportable-uris" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#darwin-core-exportable-uris"><span>Darwin Core exportable URIs</span></a></h4><p>TaxonWorks &quot;knows&quot; about certain DarwinCore fields that are not 1:1 mappable to its model. To add data to these fields, and have them export 1:1 (i.e. typing &quot;Stuff; Things&quot; results in &quot;Stuff; Things&quot; being exported into the field) to your DarwinCore exports do this:</p><ul><li>Determine if the DwC attribute you want to use is &quot;known&quot; by TaxonWorks. At present it&#39;s best to do this by looking at the code itself, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks/development/config/initializers/constants/_controlled_vocabularies/dwc_attribute_uris.rb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here is the list</a>. If you find your attribute (e.g. <code>asssociatedTaxa</code>) then note (cpy to your clipboard) the URI it corresponds to (in our example <code>http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/associatedTaxa</code>).</li><li>In the <code>Manage controlled vocabulary terms</code> task create a new <code>Predicate</code>, name it typically 1:1 with the name of the DwC field, but this is required, the magic is in the Uri field.</li><li>Add the URI to your Predicate that you found in from the file above by pasting or typing it in.</li></ul><p>You may want to add the field to directly to the UI, for example the <code>New collecting event</code> task or <code>Comprehensive specimen digitization</code>, <a href="#custom-fields">see above</a> for how to do this.</p><p>At this point you have a new field in TaxonWorks that will be exported to DwC when requested.</p><p><em>Note that on export no processing or validation is done on the export of these fields, you get in the export what you type in the field.</em></p><h3 id="tags" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tags"><span>Tags</span></a></h3><p>Tags are used an arbitrary label with your <a href="/guide/glossary#object">object</a>. Think of tags as data attributes with no value. To create a type of Tag create a <code>Keyword</code> in the CVT manager. You can apply tags in the radial annotator, in batch in filter interfaces, and in various other ways.</p><p><em>Note that technically a Tag is the link (or join) between a Keyword (CVT) and an Object, not the Keyword itself.</em></p><h3 id="protocols" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#protocols"><span>Protocols</span></a></h3><p>Tagging an object with a Protocol asserts &quot;some or all of the data in here came from this process. Create new protocols via <code>Data</code>-&gt;<code>Protocols</code>. You can attach PDFs describing your protocol to your Protocol to expand its description.</p><h3 id="alternate-values" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#alternate-values"><span>Alternate values</span></a></h3><p>Alternate values reference a TaxonWorks field and provide a way to include a Translation, Abbreviation, Misspelling or Alternate spelling. To create one:</p><ul><li>Open the radial annotator for the record in question</li><li>Select <code>Alternate values</code></li><li>Select the type of alternate value (e.g. Abbreviation)</li><li>Select the target field (e.g. <code>title</code> of a source)</li><li>Add the value, and click Create.</li></ul><p><em>Alternate values are not allowed on the <code>name</code> of a TaxonName, don&#39;t even think about requesting this.</em></p><h3 id="identifiers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#identifiers"><span>Identifiers</span></a></h3><p>Identifiers are broader subject (i.e. we need further discussion here). Briefly, there are two types in TaxonWorks, &quot;Global&quot;, and &quot;Local&quot;. The latter are in essence those types of identifiers that people thought really hard about, and tried to make universally applicable, the former, not so much.</p><p>In the real-world there are no-such-things as &quot;unique&quot; identifiers per <a href="/about/glossary#object">object</a>. TaxonWorks embraces this philosophy by allowing you to add as many identifiers to your data as you want. Identifiers can be used to say and do things like:</p><ul><li>Conceptually, my digital thing is the <code>same_as</code> your digital thing</li><li>If you find my identifier you&#39;ll likely be able to find my thing (e.g. a <code>Identifier::Local::CatalogNumber</code> that represents a physical label <code>localized_to</code> my specimen)</li><li>The same things has two different &quot;unique&quot; identifiers, and that thing is my thing</li><li>I&#39;m tracking (integrating/referencing/relating) this thing in my project, but with minimal detail, you can get more details on this thing if you can find other things &quot;out there&quot; with the same Identifier</li><li>My thing is the Person with this ORCiD (Identifier)</li><li>My thing historically could be found (your results may vary now) with this Identifier</li><li>I want to make labels for my specimens that reference my trip-codes so that I can quickly call them up, print them, assign them to Specimens, etc., and darn it my (Matt&#39;s) &quot;MJY-YYYY&quot; codes do not mean &quot;Mark Jupiter Yahoo&quot;, but I need their (Mark&#39;s) &quot;MJY&quot; codes too. You can keep them the same, but different, using TaxonWorks&#39; Namespaces.</li><li>Print labels and barcodes in TaxonWorks</li></ul><h3 id="notes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#notes"><span>Notes</span></a></h3><p>Notes are the most unrestricted annotation type, you&#39;re simply adding a block of text (Markdown is allowed) to a record. You <em>should not</em> assume that all notes of are of some type. You should also not use Notes because you want something to appear <em>somewhere</em>, it&#39;s much better to do this with a more defined annotation such as a data attribute.</p><h3 id="verifiers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#verifiers"><span>Verifiers</span></a></h3><p>A Verifier is a very generic way of saying &quot;This Person verified this record&quot;. It links a Person object with a role &quot;verifier&quot; to your data. There are no sub-types of verification, for that functionality see <a href="#confidences">Confidences</a>.</p><h3 id="documentation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#documentation"><span>Documentation</span></a></h3><p>Some classes of data can be &quot;documented&quot;, this simply means attaching a link to a binary document (e.g. pdf) to the record. The assertion being made is &quot;this binary file contains the content of that thing&quot;, as in &quot;This is the PDF of that Source&quot;.</p><h3 id="confidences" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#confidences"><span>Confidences</span></a></h3><p>Projects can create their own arbitrary levels of <a href="/models#confidence">Confidence</a> (think data-quality) that they can use to annotate there data with.
