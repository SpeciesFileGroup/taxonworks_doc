The easiest way to access sources is through the <code>Source hub</code> task. This is a unifying task that combines several commonly used tasks associated with sources. As a curator, researcher, data manager, student, or technician you may primarily be working from sources that are published papers. Source data can be entered one record at-a-time field-by-field, or using BibTeX or CrossRef DOIs. From most reference manager software, one can export source information in the BibTex format and edit as needed in any regular text editor. This can be used for uploading <code>source</code> data into TW. With this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wiki</a>, you can learn more about BibTex.</p><figure><img src="https://sfg.taxonworks.org/s/rdc03q" alt="" title="Screenshot of user interface for the Source hub task"><figcaption class="figure-left"><strong>Legend:</strong> <code>Source hub</code> user interface sections: <code>select</code>, <code>filter</code>, <code>recent sources</code>, add <code>new source</code>, and <code>batch load</code>. </figcaption></figure><h3 id="source-hub-task-features" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#source-hub-task-features"><span><code>Source hub</code> task features</span></a></h3><h4 id="select-a-source" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#select-a-source"><span>Select a <code>Source</code></span></a></h4><p>The TW <code>Select a source</code> option offers a smart selector so you only need to enter as many letters needed to uniquely identify a source.

This section features commonly used fields. See the scenarios section to find related activities that fit your workflows.</p><ul><li>First, using the <code>Source hub</code> always check to be sure the source is not already in TW. If it isn’t found in the search box in the Source Hub, &#39;—None—&#39; will appear below it. With TW &quot;smart&quot; searches you need only provide enough minimal text to find the source (e.g. misspellings may cause you to miss a source).</li><li>Clicking <code>New Source</code> in the <code>Source Hub</code> brings up this screen.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://sfg.taxonworks.org/s/nhjizu" alt="" title="screenshot of the New Source user interfact"><figcaption class="figure-left">New Source user interface options. Note you may reorder the fields as you see fit using the <code>Sortable fields</code> box in the upper right.</figcaption></figure><ul><li>The yellow triangle means you have made changes that have not been saved.</li><li>Be sure to <code>Save</code> before you leave this screen, or changes will be lost.</li><li>If you have the DOI for a new source, this button provides access to the CrossRef database of DOIs. If it works (it usually does), most of the fields you need will be filled in. Be sure to <em>check them</em>, as they are not always correct.</li><li>If you have the reference in BibTex format (most reference databases will output this), you can input it here. <ul><li>From Zotero, simply select the reference, right-click on it, select &quot;export item&quot; and save the file as BibTeX.</li><li>From EndNote, select the reference and fill out the &quot;label&quot; field. Then go to File &gt; export and select &quot;text file&quot;, &quot;BibTeX export&quot;. Most people don’t fill out the &quot;label&quot; field in their EndNote database, but if you don’t, you will have to add the label manually by editing the exported text file (that is the field highlighted in the example below).</li><li>In the <code>New Source Form</code>, Choose the blue <code>BibTex</code> box at the top of the screen, and paste in the exported *.txt file. (No drag and drop here).</li></ul></li></ul><p>Most of the fields may be self-explanatory. Here we note a few tricks, for instance:</p><ul><li><p>Entering an author name in this box (5) <code>Authors</code> tries to pull it up from the table of known authors. If it isn’t found, you can use the <code>Add New</code> button that appears in this case. This is an advantage in some situations over entering authors as verbatim text (in the Verbatim from BibTex field lower in the screen), because you can easily pull them up later, for example, when adding author names to new species.</p></li><li><p>Similarly, below the <code>Author</code> section is a search box for <code>Serials</code> (journals). If the journal is not found, look for the <code>New</code> button to the right of the Serial screen. This opens a screen for you to add a serial to the serials table.</p></li><li><p>Once you have created the new source, you should go to <code>Documentation</code> in the blue <code>Radial annotator</code> to the right of the <code>Source</code> and upload the PDF file if available.</p></li><li><p>(Optional) Use the TW <code>Tag</code> feature to group and track which papers need data parsing or do not.</p><ul><li>To do this go to the Tags choice in the <code>Radial annotator</code></li><li>Tag the source as desired (e.g. <code>Unprocessed</code>)</li><li>And add other suitable tags such as <code>No Nomenclatural Acts</code> or <code>Nomenclatural Acts</code> as appropriate (this is specific for the UCD project, other projects may use different tags).</li></ul></li><li><p>If a source has a title in a language other than English, and you wish to enter the English translation (or translation in any other language), follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Enter the source with the title as given in the paper and create it.</li><li>Click on the blue <code>Radial BibTex annotator</code> to the right of the source at the top of the page, and click on the pie slice for <code>Alternate Values</code>.</li><li>Choose title from the pick-list, the language for the translated title, and paste the translation in the Value field.</li><li>Be sure to <code>Save</code> it (green button) if this is a new source. Then the original title and translation will both be rendered.</li></ul><p>As all fields are present on the data entry screen for all types of sources, it can be a bit confusing, particularly for books and chapters in books. The article type for a chapter in a book is &quot;Inbook&quot;, and the book title would go into the Booktitle field. For books, there are fields for Editors, Series (if needed), Booktitle, Publisher, and Address (usually city or city and country). The type of a technical report is <code>techreport</code>.</p></li></ul><h2 id="pdfs-for-sources" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pdfs-for-sources"><span>PDFs for Sources</span></a></h2><p>Using the UCD@TW Project as an example, note that most screens that pull up lists of sources in TW have a convenient PDF icon that either opens the source in the PDF viewer (where you can download it), or enables you to download it directly to your browser.

Among the search fields, which can be used in any combination, are the following:</p><ul><li><code>Keywords</code>: search text or title. These are verbatim text search fields that will scan the title or other text fields for keywords, such as taxon names. However, if the name is not in the title, it may not get picked up.</li><li><code>Authors</code>: self explanatory. Search for authors verbatim or for authors in the Authors data table.</li><li><code>Date</code>: you can provide starting and ending years for the search.</li><li><code>Tags</code>: If a source has been tagged, you can search for the tag(s) here. <ul><li>You can batch tag sources using the method described below.</li><li>(UCD@TW specific note: However, this will apply mostly to literature that has been added since the transfer of sources from UCD@NHM to UCD@TW).</li></ul></li><li><code>Topics</code>: This is one of the potentially most powerful uses of this utility. All of the tags to citations from UCD@NHM (the original UCD in London) should have been carried over to UCD@TW on import. Thus, UCD@TW folks can search for papers containing host information, keys to species, redescriptions, or any of the topics in the Topics list. Note that if you have Topics in your pinboard, they will appear here if you select Pinboard. Or you can Search for a topic or pull up the entire list of topics using All.</li></ul><p>Once you have created a list of sources, you can do the following:</p><ul><li><code>Select All</code> (button is at top left) or <code>Select Individual Sources</code>.</li><li><code>Tag</code>: once you have selected sources you can tag them using whatever tag or tags are in your pinboard by hitting the green <code>Tag</code> button. If there is more than one tag indicated as the default in your pinboard, both will be added.

If no PDF is associated with the source, the PDF icon will not show. You will need to find a pdf for the source outside of TW, and add it using the <code>Radial Annotator</code>, as shown above.</p><p>Note that there is a red button to <code>remove from project</code>. This is because references are SHARED across projects in TaxonWorks, that is, if someone outside UCD already created this source record, you should be able to simply add it. Note that reference data for sources are shared, but not PDFs.</p><p>The blue buttons to the right are the <code>BibTex Annotator</code> for sources, described above, and the <code>Navigate Radial</code> (looks like a compass arrow), which brings up various functions, including an <em>edit slice</em> which takes you to the source editor.</p><h3 id="document-information-from-a-newly-published-source" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#document-information-from-a-newly-published-source"><span>Document information from a newly published source</span></a></h3><p>When a new source (paper/book/etc.) is published and you want to document the information it contains, note the following steps.</p><p>(Historically, this workflow is described in-depth as an exercise in the former documentation repository in &quot;basic_article_parsing.md&quot; which you can find in <a href="https://docs.taxonworks.org/guide/other-documents.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Other Documents</a> from the left sidebar).</p><ol><li>Go to the <code>Source Hub</code> task card, search the sources in TW to see if it exists.</li><li>If it doesn’t then create it, preferably using <code>CrossRef</code> function (blue icon at top of <code>New Source</code> Screen) as described above. We recommend using <code>CrossRef</code> because it imports more metadata (<code>BibTeX</code> e.g. from Google Scholar keeps fields to a bare minimum).</li><li>If it is in the database but has not been processed, this will be indicated in the <code>Radial Annotator</code> under <code>tags</code>. Always be careful since automatically imported articles, even if they are recent, may have wrong data. For example, the year informed by the web site may not match the year of publication (usually explicitly stated in the PDF file).</li><li>Also, see immediately above for instructions on using the <code>Filter Sources</code> task.</li></ol><h3 id="add-more-species-information" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#add-more-species-information"><span>Add more species information</span></a></h3><p>To add additional information about the species from the publication, first navigate to the OTU corresponding to the new taxon name. From the <code>Browse nomenclature</code> page for the taxon, you can hit the <code>Browse OTU</code> icon at the top of the page. This takes you to the OTU that is associated with the taxon:</p><p>Alternatively, you can use the <code>Browse OTU</code> task to find the OTU. TW may bring up more than one choice:</p><figure><img src="https://sfg.taxonworks.org/s/egdwx6" alt="" title="Browse OTU task showing that more than one name may be found. Note the differences indicated by the presence of a check mark or letter &#39;c&#39; in brackets indicating a new subsequent combination."><figcaption class="figure-left"><code>Browse OTUs</code> and find the subsequent combinations</figcaption></figure><p>In this case the OTU name with the check mark refers to the protonym (name as originally published. The OTU name followed by (c) refers to a <code>subsequent combination``. It is best to choose the </code>subsequent combination`` as this will ensure that the data is tracked correctly.</p><p>(UCD-specific note: in this case, there is a third choice, which looks like a ghost, that is, a name that was created as a string when host or distribution records were imported from the original UCD@NHM. You should ignore ghosts. UCD@TW are working on eliminating them).</p><p>The most common tasks at this point will be to capture <code>Citations</code>, <code>Asserted Distributions</code>, and <code>Biological Associations</code>.</p><ul><li><code>Citations</code>. These provide a way to capture any information that is in the publication (e.g. whether it includes a diagnosis, whether the taxon is figured, information on hosts or distribution, etc.), and <code>page numbers</code> on which the information is found. Citing the exact page numbers will help subsequent users quickly find this information in long publications treating many species.</li><li>To enter this information, hit the <code>Radial Annotator</code> at top of screen</li><li>Choose <code>Citations</code>, enter the source (it should still be pinned)</li><li>Enter the exact <code>page number</code>s on which the information is found in the publication</li><li>Click <code>Create</code></li><li>Click the blue <code>All</code> button for a list of currently used topics. Select the ones that are relevant</li><li>Scroll to the bottom of the screen, and click the green <code>Create</code> button.</li><li>When you close this screen (x at upper right) you should return to the OTU (<code>Browse Taxa</code>) page. If you refresh this in your browser, you should see the <code>citation</code> you have created in the upper right.</li></ul><p>HINT: <code>Topics</code> are unique to each project. For the UCD project, having created a lot of topics now, they suggest creating a new topic only if absolutely necessary.</p><p>For those working on other projects, you can use the <code>Manage Controlled Vocabulary Terms</code> card in the Tasks portfolio to create and define new topics. Here, the <code>Keyword</code> tab at the top refers to <code>Tags</code>, discussed above, and the <code>Topic</code> tab refers to <code>Topics</code>.</p><h4 id="asserted-distributions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#asserted-distributions"><span>Asserted Distributions</span></a></h4><ul><li>Click the blue <code>Quick Forms</code> icon <img src="https://sfg.taxonworks.org/s/w7ow2j" width="20px"> at top right, and follow the instructions to pick geographic areas from which the taxon is reported. This is the place to capture information from a <code>Distribution</code> section of the publication.</li><li>Enter the <code>source</code> which should still be pinned, and the exact <code>page numbers</code> on which the distribution information is given. <ul><li><code>Is Original</code> means this is the first time that this distribution has been published.</li><li><code>Is absent</code> presumably means that the publication states that the taxon is not present in the designated area, but UCD notes they are not sure when to use this.</li></ul></li><li>Next, enter the most restrictive geographic area present in the TW database, which in most cases will be a state or a province.</li></ul><p>HINT: If the paper contains many new asserted distributions, it is more efficient to record these using the <code>New Asserted Distribution task</code>. Here you can lock in the source and each OTU, and enter the geographic areas one by one, without having to repeat the other information. In this example, we have locked the source and OTU (orange boxes), and we can enter geographic areas one by one. The task contains other tools (not shown below) that enable you to clone combinations of the Source/OTU, Source/Geographic area, or OTU/Geographic area.</p><figure><img src="https://sfg.taxonworks.org/s/fi56ai" alt="" title="new asserted distribution task showing how information can be resused to create many new assertions from a given source that have shared information"><figcaption class="figure-left"><code>New Asserted Distribution Task</code> showing how to lock fields for re-use</figcaption></figure><p>Next, update the <code>tags</code> (if necessary) to track progress. UCD Example, once you have entered the <code>distribution</code> data from the source, if you are not at this time going to enter other information such as biological associations, add the <code>Source processed – Distribution</code> tag to the source.</p><ul><li><code>Biological Associations</code>. These are also accessed from the blue <code>Quick forms</code> icon <img src="https://sfg.taxonworks.org/s/w7ow2j" width="20px/">. The form is shown below. Examples presented here are UCD-based. You may have to enter more information as host data may or maynot already be in your instance of TW.</li></ul><p>[INSERT SCREENSHOT HERE]</p><ul><li>Selecting <code>All</code> (1) will bring up a list of all <code>Biological Association</code> in the project (2).</li></ul><p>(UCD-specific note: In general for chalcidoids, you will want to capture the <code>Primary (animal) host</code> or <code>Plant host</code>, <code>Plant Associate</code> in the case of parasitoids, or Parasitoid host in the case of hyperparasitoids).</p><ul><li>Pick the relevant blue tab and then hit the blue <code>Search</code> button (4) to find the host or associate name in the TW database. In most (UCD) cases, this will be a plant or animal name, so select OTU (3). <ul><li>Search for the taxon name in the database (this brings up a select OTU search box). The UCD database is extensive, and usually the host will already be there, either as a <code>Taxon Name</code> or as an <code>OTU</code>. If TW finds either of these, it will bring them up for you to choose.</li><li>If neither are found, TW will ask you if you want to &quot;customize an OTU with that name&quot;. Say yes, and cut and paste the OTU name in the OTU box that comes up. Leave the Taxon Name box below the OTU box blank. IF YOU DO THIS, BE SURE YOU ARE SPELLING THE NAME CORRECTLY! For this reason it is best to cut and paste whenever possible. There is probably no reason to enter the author name of the OTU, but it doesn’t hurt anything.</li></ul></li><li>Once you have entered the host or associate OTU, enter the <code>Citation</code> (source) (5) and <code>page number</code>(s) on which the information is located.</li><li>As above the <code>Is original</code> box (6) means that <em>this biological association has not been published previously</em>. So check this box if this is new information not published before.</li><li>Use the <code>Browse OTUs</code> page for the taxon (accessed with the <code>Browse OTUs card</code>) to see all previous biological associations recorded in TW for that entity.</li></ul><p>At this time, there is no Biological Associations task comparable to the <code>Asserted Distributions</code> task (this has been requested of the development team).</p><ul><li>IF you are entering several new <code>Biological Associations</code> from a paper, you can <em>lock the citation</em> for the source by hitting the little lock icon next to the pinboard icon in the Citation box.</li><li>[INSERT SCREEN SHOT for above]</li></ul><p>Since most new species will be compared with other existing species, you will want to capture this information also. This is treated as another Biological Association, since any comparison will involve another OTU.</p><ul><li>Repeat the process for hosts, but choose <code>Compared With</code> (instead of associate) and follow the procedure above.</li></ul><p>After completing these tasks, close the form and return to the OTU page for the taxon. If you refresh your browser, all the new information should be displayed.</p><p>[INSERT SCREEN SHOT of OTU for a taxon showing biological associations]</p><p>Remember to make good use of the <code>tags</code> for tracking progress.</p><ul><li>If you have entered data for the biological associations reported in a paper, but are not planning to enter other data such as geographic distributions at this time, add the <code>Source processed – Biological Information</code> to the source.</li><li>If you have entered all nomenclatural acts in the paper, all relevant topics associated with the citation, all distribution information and all biological information, remove any tags associated with processing and add the tag <code>Source processed – Complete</code> to the source.

TW will accept images in PNG, TIFF, or JPEG formats. The following are probably the most common cases in which you might wish to upload images.</p><h4 id="adding-type-specimen-images" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#adding-type-specimen-images"><span>Adding <code>Type specimen</code> images</span></a></h4><ul><li>Navigate to the <code>Collection object</code> form for the type using the <code>New type specimen task</code>, or go to the <code>Type</code> screen (either <code>Quick</code> or <code>Comprehensive</code>) in the <code>Edit taxon name</code> form.</li><li>If the type has not already been recorded (which will be the case for many old names), you will need to create it first. <strong>Drag and drop</strong> the image into the <code>Depiction field</code> (it contains the text <code>Drop images here to add figures</code>), in either the <code>quick</code> or <code>comprehensive type</code> screen. <ul><li>Of course, if you do this, you need to be sure that the images are actually of the types!

We recommend using the <code>Caption</code> field only to record information associated with the image, such as &quot;Fig. 2, male head, frontal view&quot;. The <code>Label</code> field is intended for use primarily when using TW to create output such as species pages or publications.</p><p>It is also possible to batch process images using the <code>New Image</code> task, which may be more efficient if you are uploading many images from the same publication. You can drag and drop batches of images, and then assign the author/creator, source (publication), copyright information and so forth for all of them at once.
