We use <code>er</code> in the &quot;modelling a domain sense&quot;, not particularly a 1:1 description of the links between model and database (though there are numerous times where this is the case). Algorithmically drawn, their purpose is to provide an overview of how data in TaxonWorks are modelled at a generalized level. To draw these figures certain constraints are used, this means that they are cleaner looking, and not cluttered, but also that they may not completely illustrate all pertinent entities or relationships as defined for that model. Follow the <code>er</code> links or see the <code>Model</code> section. <em>Most nodes can be clicked to navigate onwards.</em></li><li>A description of the database table for each model. Tables are named as seen in the headers. Many (but not all) related tables are linked in the column name. Follow the <code>table</code> links or see the<code>Tables</code> section.</li><li>A text description of each model/class. This is provided in the context of the code for that model on a <a href="https://rdoc.taxonworks.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">separate website</a>. That website is generated with each code commit, it includes the full documentation for the TaxonWorks code-base, so it is easy to get lost for the uninitiated. Follow the <code>rdoc</code> links from the respective tables and models. Using this site as a basis for exploring <code>rdoc</code> can keep you from getting lost therein.</li><li>Direct links (<code>api</code>) to the resources behind the models as represented by TaxonWorks external facing API.
