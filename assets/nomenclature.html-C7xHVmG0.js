The first taxon attached to the Root requires selection of the Code of Nomenclature (ICZN, ICN, ICNP, ICTV). This selection is required to enforce validation rules specific to this particular Code of Nomenclature. All taxa below this taxon do not require selection of the Code, it will be inherited from the parent. The same database may contain taxa covered by different Codes of Nomenclature.</p><figure><img src="https://sfg.taxonworks.org/s/kn9ib3" alt="" title="showing how a taxa is related to the concept of root"><figcaption class="figure-left">Illustrating the concept of <code>Root</code> in TaxonWorks</figcaption></figure><p>See this next screenshot to show how you can have other taxa at the <code>Root</code> as needed, that reference a different Code of Nomenclature.</p><figure><img src="https://sfg.taxonworks.org/s/p13yje" alt="" title="3 taxa shown at level of root"><figcaption class="figure-left">Showing several taxa that cross kingdoms and Codes of Nomenclature at the level of root</figcaption></figure><h3 id="conceptual-approach" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#conceptual-approach"><span>Conceptual approach</span></a></h3><p>To understand nomenclature in TaxonWorks it&#39;s important to understand that the basic idea is to accumulate/add new facts rather than update, change, or delete existing records. This is incredibly liberating in many ways, as the system will resolve the current status by inferring across the facts that you have added. As an example, rather than think &quot;how do I change this name to invalid&quot;, think &quot;how do I add the fact that so-and-so stated this name is invalid&quot;. The name was valid in the past, now we add a fact to indicate somebody more recently thinks it&#39;s invalid. The system will look at the years the facts were applied and then summarize the facts as we presently see them. This also lets the complete nomenclatural history, in all its gory detail, be recorded.</p><h3 id="authorship" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#authorship"><span>Authorship</span></a></h3><p>In the <code>Author</code> section of <code>Edit taxon name</code> you have <em>three optional ways</em> to pick from to record authorship.

It is recommended to track changes of a family-group name at the lovest coordinate rank taxon. For example, if you have a family, subfamily, and tribe based on the same genus name, all history should be added to the protonym at the tribe level (regardless at what level the name was treated in the literature historically).</p><h4 id="example" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#example"><span>Example</span></a></h4><p>For tribe <em>Cicadini</em> in the <code>Edit TaxonName</code> the following could be reported: <code>Original form</code>: <em>Cicadina</em><code>Subsequent forms</code>: <em>Cicadini</em><em>Cicadinae</em><em>Cicadidae</em></p><h3 id="citations" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#citations"><span>Citations</span></a></h3><h4 id="incertae-sedis" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#incertae-sedis"><span>Incertae sedis</span></a></h4><p><em>Incertae sedis</em> implies a relationship between two protonyms.

Remember that we only care about the nomenclatural consequences of the use of the names in question. Taxon Identifications are linkages of <code>OTUs</code> to <code>Collection objects</code>, this is the preferred mechanism for linking one or more identifications to a collection object.</p><p>A question from a user reflects the trickiness:</p><ol><li>Imagine there is a genus <em>Aus</em>, with type species <em>Aus bus</em>. Then someone describes a new species <em>Aus cus</em>, which subsequent authors don&#39;t even consider to be in the same superfamily. So I cannot enter <em>Aus</em> twice because the second one is a misidentification but no one knows for sure what it is.</li></ol><p>This is just an <code>original genus</code>. This is the same genus in both species. The genus cannot be misidentified. This is just a position of the species in classification, regardless where it was originally described or subsequently placed.</p><p>The proper way to handle this is to use a single <em>Aus</em>, which is placed in the correct family. In both species <em>Aus</em> is the <code>Original genus</code>, in <em>Aus bus</em>, this is also a <code>Parent taxon</code>. In case of <em>Aus cus</em>, if the current genus is not assigned, the superfamily is the parent taxon. An <em>incertae sedis</em> relationship should connect <em>Aus cus</em> and the superfamily.</p><ol start="2"><li>Species misidentification/misapplication.</li></ol><p>Misapplication itself does not make an available name. But this a common practice to include misapplication in the list of historical usages of the taxon names, especially in the cases where a new name is proposed as a &quot;replacement&quot; for a previously misidentified species. Remember, that <em>nomen novum</em> cannot be proposed for misapplication, since it requires a previously available name, but invalid because of homonymy.</p><p>To record this in TaxonWorks, a <code>new Protonym</code> for a misapplied name should be created in the database. This Protonym should be linked to two other <code>Taxon Names</code> with two <code>Taxon Name Relationships</code>. The first relationship is to an available name with the same spelling (it could be a valid name or a synonym). The <code>relationship type</code> is <code>Misapplication</code>. The second relationship <code>Invalidating</code> relationship should link this <code>TaxonName</code> to the correct name for this taxon. Remember, the <code>Synonym</code> relationship is not applicable here, since it assumes that both names are available name, and in this example <code>Misapplication</code> is not an available name. Follow the soft validation messages for other essential information for the <code>Protonym</code> in the database.</p><p>An example: The name <em>Aus aus</em> Author 1, is a misapplication for <em>Aus bus</em>, and <em>Aus aus</em> Author 2 is a completely different species.</p><p>After the Protonym for the first name is created two relationships will be added in the database:</p><ul><li><em>Aus aus</em> Author 1 Misapplication, linked to <em>Aus aus</em> Author 2</li><li><em>Aus aus</em> Author 1 Invalid, linked to <em>Aus bus</em></li></ul><p>Once the misapplication is created, an <code>OTU</code> could be linked to the <code>TaxonName</code>, which could be used, for example, for <code>taxon determination</code>.</p><h2 id="nomenclature-senarios-aka-how-to" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#nomenclature-senarios-aka-how-to"><span>Nomenclature Senarios (aka How-To)</span></a></h2><h3 id="add-new-taxon-name" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#add-new-taxon-name"><span>Add new taxon name</span></a></h3><p>For this task, be sure you have put the <code>source</code> in the <code>Pinboard</code> and selected it as the <code>default</code>, as this will save a lot of time during the process.

For example, if you are creating a new genus with 2 new species, first create the genus, and then create the two new species.

These don’t change gender when transferred to other genera with a different gender. An example might be a name like <em>Aphelinus mali</em>, named after the common host, the woolly apple aphid. An arbitrary combination of letters is treated as a noun.</li><li><code>Noun in genitive case</code>. These are commonly patronyms, ending in “-i” for males and “-ae” for females.</li><li><code>Participle</code>. A participle is an adjectival form of a verb.
