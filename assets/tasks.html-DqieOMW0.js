You will need to check any data related to the objects you want to unify.</p><h3 id="determining-objects-records-are-identical" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#determining-objects-records-are-identical"><span>Determining objects (records) are identical</span></a></h3><p>Because data in TaxonWorks may be related to other data in many different ways there are some nuances to ensuring two things really are the same. A mental checklist to confirming identity might look like this:</p><ol><li><p>Determine that the <em>attributes</em> of the record are identical, or similar enough. For example you see that there are 2 OTUs, each has <code>name</code> = &#39;Aus sp2&#39;, and neither has a taxon_name_id. In other words, no Taxon Name in the Nomenclature model, each object existing only as an OTU.</p></li><li><p>Determine that the <em>annotations</em> on the record are identical, or similar enough. For example the 2 OTUs in question may both have a Note attached to them. One reads &quot;Added by M. Kelly&quot; the other &quot;From Kelly&quot;. In particular review <code>DataAttribute</code> annotations.</p></li><li><p>Determine that related data linked to the object are identical, or similar enough. For example we might find that both OTUs are used in an <code>AssertedDistributions</code>, and both AssertedDistributions reference Counties that are side-by-side, and that these AssertedDistributions share a <code>Citation</code> to the same <code>Source</code>. You can use the <code>Related data</code> report via the radial navigator in side-by-side tabs to compare this information.</p></li></ol><h2 id="what-happens-when-you-unify" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-happens-when-you-unify"><span>What happens when you Unify</span></a></h2><div class="hint-container caution"><p class="hint-container-title">Caution</p><p>Unify does not merge the attributes of the two objects in question if they differ (e.g. #1 above).
