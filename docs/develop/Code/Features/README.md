# Scenarios

_Ways to add to TaxonWorks using commonly used patterns._

In coding TaxonWorks there are a number of patterns that the basis for adding and maintaining features in or around TaxonWorks. Here are _some_:

* **Add a new data model, from back end to (very) basic UI** - See [Scaffolding](/develop/Code/Features/scaffolding)
* **Add a new Task to the UI** - See [TaxonWorks task](/develop/Code/Features/taxonworks_tasks)
* **Write a script to add, alter, or report data** - See [Rake task](/develop/Code/Features/rake_task)
* **Configure a radial menu** - See [Radial](/develop/Code/Features/radial)

While you code you will want to add and [run tests](/develop/Code/Features/tests) to ensure you're not unintentionally breaking things, and to ensure others can refactor what you've done.
