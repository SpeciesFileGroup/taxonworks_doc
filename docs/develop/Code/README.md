# Overview

_You **can** code (TaxonWorks). Here's where to learn how._


::: warning
TODO: Discussion of modularity, TW tasks, scaffolding, future evolution of the UI/UX. Point to What/is/not TW sections as they evolve.
:::

TaxonWorks reduces the barrier to contributing code by using two widely-used frameworks throughout it, [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). Rails is the framework Django was modelled after, so those coming from coding Python web-apps will immediately feel at home in many ways.

## Software Stack
* Ruby ([version](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks/blob/development/.ruby-version))
* Rails (version: see [`gem 'rails'`](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks/blob/development/Gemfile))
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
* Node
* Webpack
* PostgreSQL 15 with postgis 3.4
* ImageMagick 7
