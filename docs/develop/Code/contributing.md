# Contributing

See also [Contributing](/CContributing/) for non-code contributions.


- Make a new branch off of the development branch (see [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/))
 - It helps if the branch tracks an issue number, like `1234_my_feature_request`
- Add tests 
- If you have experience, rebase your branch against development before making a [pull request](/about/Glossary#Pull-request)
- Make a pull request
  - From your repository on Github select your branch, and use buttons there to make a [pull request](/about/Glossary#Pull-request).

## Conventions
- Various README.md and ARCHITECTURE.md files exist in the code-base
- We have a code linter (Rubocop), but it is not heavily used
- Code [documentation](http://rdoc.taxonworks.org) is done inline with [Yard tags](https://rubydoc.info/gems/yard/file/docs/Tags.md).
