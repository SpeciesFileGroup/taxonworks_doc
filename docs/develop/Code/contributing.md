# Contributing

See also [Contributing](/Contributing/) for non-code contributions.

- Make a new branch off of the development branch (see [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/))
 - It helps if the branch tracks an issue number, like `1234_my_feature_request`
- Add tests
- If you have experience, rebase your branch against development
- Make a pull request, if using Github see [pull request](/about/glossary#pull-request)
