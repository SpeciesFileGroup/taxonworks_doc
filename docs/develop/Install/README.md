_How do I install TaxonWorks both in development and production environments? What tools and environments faciliate the development of TaxonWorks?_

TaxonWorks installation is typically for one of the following puproses:

1. **[Development](Development/)** - TaxonWorks is installed for coding purposes.
2. [Production](Production/) -  TaxonWorks is installed for serving/use purposes.
3. **Personal use (offline)** - TaxonWorks is installed locally (e.g. on your own machine) for use, but not coding TaxonWorks purposes, for example:
* To ensure the integrity of your project backup
* To review, access, or analyze your projects data. For example:
  * Via SQL in a PostgreSQL client
  * Via the console and TaxonWorks data-model code
  * Via API calls directly to your local instance, useful particularly if you are developing data analysis locally in R, Python, or a Notebook
* To explore configuration options, for example UI customizations.

Offline use is through a [Development](Development/) environment.
