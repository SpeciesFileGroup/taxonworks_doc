# Overview 

A project like TaxonWorks needs diverse contributions from many to succeed over the long-term. Technically, taxonWorks adopts a range of strategies to make it successful from a development standpoint, highlights include:

* **Open source** - All elements of the project are open source under an MIT [license](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks/blob/development/LICENSE.txt).
* **Live technical support** - Via weekly, year-round support meetings, online-chat, and video-conference on demand. Connect via [Events](https://speciesfilegroup.org/events).
* **Tests** - TaxonWorks has extensive tests helping to maintain application cohesiveness and to prevent the introduction of errors.
* **Documentation** - The project is well documented both here, and in code and everyone is encouraged to contribute to it.
* **Continuous integration (CI)** - Code is tested and builds created via CI, meaning all contributions trigger tests, and builds can be deployed with minimal effort.
* **Code Generators** - Stub a new task view (core feature) or batch-loader so that coding experiments can start instantly.
* **JSON API ("dogfooding")** - TaxonWorks largely uses RESTful conventions, and a JSON serving back end that is nearly 1:1 accessible via a public-facing front end, this means if you can imagine using it externally, you can.
* **Containerized** - TaxonWorks is available as a [Docker](/develop/Install/Development/Docker/) container facilitating deployment, development, and local use.
* **Meta-projects** - Example meta-projects exist, for example [taxonworks_stats](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks_stats) ([demo](https://stats.taxonworks.org)) illustrating how to build an application off of the API 
* **Rails** - TaxonWorks is built on [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org), a framework used by Github, Shopify, and other major projects that produce web-applications. This ensure that there is a large, well established pool of potential expertise to draw from. It further provides a framework of _conventions_ that facilitate maintenance over time.
* **Hackathons and Workshops** - The [Species File Group](https://speciesfilegroup.org) and its members have held hackathons and many in-house joint workshops. Contact them if you're interested in participating on site.  They are also interested in supporting visits to would-be developers, students, or others wishing to get a boot-camp in TaxonWorks development.
